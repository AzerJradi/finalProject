        <p class="para">Mercedes-Benz, founded in 1926, is a renowned German automaker. It was originally established by Karl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler, pioneers in the automotive industry. The first car, the Benz Patent-Motorwagen, was created by Karl Benz in 1886. The latest offerings from Mercedes include cutting-edge models like the AMG GT series. The most expensive Mercedes is often a part of the exclusive Maybach line, such as the Maybach Exelero. The most popular car would be a subjective choice, but the Mercedes C-Class and E-Class are widely acclaimed. As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, Daimler AG owned Mercedes-Benz, but the ownership structure may have changed since then.</p>

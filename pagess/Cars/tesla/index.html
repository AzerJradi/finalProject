        <p class="para">Tesla, founded in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, introduced its first car, the Tesla Roadster, in 2008. Since then, the company has evolved, and its latest car, the Tesla Model S Plaid, showcases cutting-edge technology. The most expensive Tesla car currently available is the Model X Plaid. Tesla's most popular car is the Model 3, known for its affordability and widespread adoption. As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, Elon Musk serves as the CEO and owner of Tesla, making significant advancements in the electric vehicle industry. Please note that the details may have changed since then, and I recommend verifying the latest information for the most up-to-date facts.</p>
